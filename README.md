# TinyApp Project 

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This app was designed for learning purposes. It is strictly intended for use as an exercise.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.
